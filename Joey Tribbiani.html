  <h1>Joey Tribbiani</h1>
. <img src="images (14).jpeg"width="50%"/>
  <p>
   Joey is portrayed as promiscuous and dim-witted but good-natured, as well as very loyal, caring, and protective of his friends. He is a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members. In contrast to his persona as the "ladies' man", he has also a marked childish side.
