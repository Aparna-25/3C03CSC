  <p>
    Phoebe is a masseuse and musician, notable for her offbeat and extremely ditzy behavior. She was Monica Geller's roommate before Rachel Green, which is how she was introduced to the group.
  </p>
  <p>
   She plays acoustic guitar and sings simple, awkward songs at Central Perk, occasionally busking also. During the show's ninth season, Phoebe is set up on a blind date with Mike Hannigan (played by actor <a href="https://g.co/kgs/yhGb6x"target="_blank">Paul Rudd<a/>) and they eventually marry in the last season.
